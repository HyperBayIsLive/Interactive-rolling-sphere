# ⚽️ Interactive Rolling Sphere (Three.js)

This is a web-based interactive 3D experience built using **Three.js**, featuring a draggable and rotatable sphere with realistic rolling physics, keyboard controls, and fullscreen toggle support.

> 🎯 **Purpose:** This lightweight project serves as a prototype for exploring intuitive 3D object interaction using modern WebGL tools.

## ✨ Features

* 🖱️ **Drag-to-Roll Mechanics**
  Click and drag the sphere to move and rotate it in real-time.

* 🔁 **Camera Orbiting**
  Click-drag outside the sphere to rotate the camera around it.

* 🎨 **Striped Custom Texture**
  Generated dynamically using an HTML canvas texture.

* 🎮 **Keyboard Controls**

  * `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight`: Smooth spin with acceleration
  * `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown`: Zoom in and out

* 🖥️ **Responsive Design**
  Automatically resizes canvas on window resize.

* ⛶ **Fullscreen Toggle**
  One-click button to enter or exit fullscreen mode.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.html` file:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-rolling-sphere.git
   ```

2. Open the file with a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

3. Interact with the sphere using your mouse or keyboard.

✅ No build tools or local server required.

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations

* 🧭 Camera controls may behave erratically if the mouse is moved too fast.
* 📱 Mobile device interaction is limited (no touch support yet).
* 🌍 No physics engine used—movement is visual only (no real-world mass/momentum).
* 🧩 Fullscreen toggle may not work on unsupported browsers.

> Contributions or pull requests to improve interaction, physics, or mobile support are welcome!
